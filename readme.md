# Analyzing Hip Hop Music using What.CD data

I recently started digging through mid-90's Memphis hip hop (there's a lot of really good stuff there, if you didn't know), and I had the hunch that Memphis made a lot of hip hop for its small size (small compared to LA, NYC etc). So I got info on 25k torrents from What.CD, and I compared the number of torrents tagged from each city to the 2010 census population (FYI, Atlanta makes the most hip hop per person). 

Anyway, that only broaches other questions! Here are some of my analyses on this dataset (the Jupyter Notebooks are also included in this repo!).

- **Which city makes the most hip hop, relative to its population?** [Link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nolanbconaway/hip.hop.data/blob/master/analyses.ipynb). 
- **Which coast (East, West, Third?) makes the most hip hop?** [Link forthcoming]

Here are some ideas for follow-ups.

- **Linear regression**. Instead of simple ratios, show bar plot of each city's residual from the linear regression.
- **Plotly fixes**: get rid of the hover toolbar. get rid of grid subplot printout.
- **Artist share**: pie charts of the top artists in the big cities.
- **Tag frequency on a map**. Put the frequency of tags (or population ratio) on a US map.
